# MySmallBlog

A small blog application made in Laravel with Bootsrap, and JQuery, using CKEditor for editing and Dropzone.js for image uploading.

# Setup

## 1. Setting up database

 1. Create a database named **my-small-blog**
 2. Run the migrations: ```php artisan migrate```
 3. Run the seeders: ```php artisan db:seed --class=RoleSeeder``` and ```php artisan db:seed --class=AdminSeeder``` (always run the RoleSeeder first, otherwise the second seeder will exit with the error: ```'Admin role does not exist. Run the RoleSeeder first!'```)
Now that you have set up the database, you can log in as admin with the following email/password combination:
Email: admin@admin.com
Password: p@$$w0rd0123

## 2. Start server
```php artisan serve```

## 3. Receiving mails
The mailing function was tested with devmail but feel free to change the mail settings in the .env file.
